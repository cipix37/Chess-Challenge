## Chess coding challange
Welcome to the [chess coding challenge](https://youtu.be/iScy18pVR58)! This is a friendly competition in which your goal is to create a small chess bot (in C#) using the framework provided in this repository.
Once submissions close, these bots will battle it out to discover which bot is best!

I will then create a video exploring the implementations of the best and most unique/interesting bots.
I also plan to make a small game that features these most interesting/challenging entries, so that everyone can try playing against them.

## Submission Due Date
October 1st 2023.<br>
Entries can be submitted over [here](https://forms.gle/6jjj8jxNQ5Ln53ie6).<br>
You are free to edit your entry at any point up to the due date.
